## Overview

In this project, I am taking a break from building my professional portfolio and challenging myself to do something a little more fun. I don't have a lot of experience with API's, so I'm going to create a radom quote generating app. This will give me experience with using a public API. Once I get the bare bones completed, I will see what additions can be made that will make the app even more engaging.
